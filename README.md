CyanogenMod 10.1 for Hyundai T7S

Create a folder named 'hyundai' (without quotes) inside your CM10.1 repo (usually android/system/device).
Place these folders (smdk4x12-common, t7s, txx-common) in it.
Invoke 'brunch t7s' to build.

Note: this is early work, probably will not produce a working image (i.e will brick your tablet).
I'm only releasing this in order for some more knowledgeable ppl to work on it.

This port requires the SMDK4412 kernel source tree; you can get it by invoking 'breakfast n8013'.

Best of luck.
